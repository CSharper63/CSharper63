# About me

I am [Maxime Chantemargue](https://maxime.chantemargue.ch), 24 years old. I am a security engineer with strong knowledge in secured software engineering and applied cryptography.

Here is a list of security project I made during my studies:
- [**LoRaWAN 1.1 analysis - Bachelor thesis**](https://github.com/CSharper63/tb_iscs_lorawan)
- [**Encrypted sharing filesystem**](https://github.com/CSharper63/client_encryption_file_system): a PoC in Rust system that allows you to store and share your files securely. Everything is end-to-end encrypted.

I am also co-founder at [Tutorapp](https://tutorapp.ch). A world wide platform that aims to connect people looking for tutoring with those offering it. It is available on Android and iOS. I created it with my friend in my first year of bachelor (2021-2022). I totally coded it in my spare time.

## Knowledge & skills
- **Cloud**: GCP, Firebase (strong), AWS
- **Database**: NoSql, relational (postgre, mysql), time series.
- **Language**: Dart(flutter framework), Java, C, C++, Rust
- **Forensics**: with volatility and remnux. [Here you can check forensics analysis](malware_analysis/) made in AMM course at [HEIG-VD](https://heig-vd.ch).
- **Side channel**: attacks on AES with chipwhisperer. [Here you can find attacks](side_channel_attacks/) made in Side-Channel/Fault Attack course at [HEIG-VD](https://heig-vd.ch).
- **Penetration testing**: kali, nessus, code analysis. (I have already processed to a real pen-test)
- **DevOps/SecOps**: github actions, gitlab, hashicorp vault
- **API/Security**: firebase appcheck, rocket.rs, express.js

## Hackathon and side project
I love challenge, that's why I made other projects during my studies such as:
- [Greenquest](https://greenquest.ch) at EPFL Lauzhack 2023 with a friend in only 24h.
- [Caffeino](https://caffeino.ch) with friends during spare time in my last year of bachelor.
